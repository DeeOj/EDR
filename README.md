# PROJECT: ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE (HOMELAB)

## INTRODUCTION

This lab involves setting up two virtual machines: one as an attack machine running Ubuntu Server and another as a victim machine running Windows 11. The attack machine is used to execute adversarial commands, mimicking the actions of a threat actor. The victim machine is equipped with Sysmon for detailed system monitoring and LimaCharlie EDR for advanced threat detection and response capabilities. Through this setup, utilizing Eric Capuano's guide, I explore the processes of telemetry collection, detection rule creation, and response rule implementation to effectively neutralize simulated attacks.

## OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to simulate a realistic cyber attack scenario and demonstrate effective detection and response strategies using advanced security tools
